# Sales_Data_Projection_Project

## Overview

The Sales Data Projection Project is designed to generate mock sales order data, store it in an AWS DynamoDB table, and process it using an AWS Lambda function. The goal is to simulate real-time order data processing by capturing and transforming order information for further analytics.
